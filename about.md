# Maureen C. Stone
My research interests are in the multi-disciplinary areas of perception, design, and interactive visualization. Broadly speaking, I am interested in understanding both why good principles of visual design work cognitively and perceptually, and how they can be applied to computer-generated visualizations, presentations, and interfaces.
