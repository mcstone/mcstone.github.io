Personal website for Maureen C. Stone

While best known for my expertise in digital color and its application, I have a broad interest in the multi-disciplinary areas of perception, design, and interactive visualization. I retired from Tableau Research in 2022, but remain a (somewhat)active member of the research community. 

I'm currently a research adjunct at the Univerisity of Washington, where I mostly spend my time with the folks in the [Interactive Data Lab](https://idl.cs.washington.edu/). I've recently started a project with [Andrew McNutt](https://www.mcnutt.in/), around tools to help people create excellent color palettes.
